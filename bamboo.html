                <p><b>Located in Ben Cat District, Binh Duong Province, Phu An Ecological Bamboo Museum and Botanical Reserve, also known as the Phu An Bamboo Village, is one of the biggest bamboo museums in Southeast Asia. <br> <br>This multipurpose centre promotes scientific research and ecosystem conservation while promoting environmental awareness and the value of ecotourism in the local community.</b></p>

                <span class="center"><img src="images/phuan.jpg" width="560" height="400" alt="valley" /></span>

                <p> The ecosystem of the village of Phu An is centered around the Saigon River, which provides the local population with the essential ecosystem services of freshwater provision, soil and nutrient cycling, timber, food, carbon sequestration, and more. The surroundings forests were severely degraded due to wartime activities, and have since declined further due to anthropogenic pressures. There remains, however, a highly diverse agro-ecosystem – extending from the lowlands near the river up to the highlands – where bamboo, cashew, fruit and rubber trees are cultivated and form the basis of local livelihoods. The riverbank ecosystem also retains an abundance of biodiversity. Fish, eel and shrimp provide the local population with a measure of food security, riverside plants are used for cooking and medicinal products, and rice paddies thrive on the floodplain, providing food and an additional source of income. Among the most important of resources in this ecosystem is bamboo.</p>

                <p>As a resource, bamboo has a long and unfortunate history in the region of mismanagement, undervaluation, and unsustainable exploitation. Traditional methods of farming bamboo have tended towards indiscriminate harvesting techniques, with farmers often cutting bamboo stalks and shoots before they have reached full maturity or been able to reproduce. So too, economic isolation and marginalization in the village and surrounding region has forced the local population to place unsustainable pressure on surrounding bamboo forests to meet subsistence and livelihood needs.</p>

                <p>At this confluence of deepening poverty and environmental decline, architects of this project set out with a vision of improving the wellbeing and livelihoods of the local community by making use of traditional knowledge systems in medicinal plants and cooking. In particular, the initiative wanted to target bamboo, recognizing that the plant is endowed with properties – rapid growth, hardiness, and sheer volume of timber production – that make it uniquely wellsuited to efforts in poverty reduction, landscape restoration and soil erosion control. </p>

                <p>The idea emerged of transforming Phu An Village into an ecological restoration and conservation area, where local residents were championed as managers and stewards of natural resources, biodiversity and traditional knowledge. The name and concept of ‘Bamboo Village’, which was originally proposed to the community in 1999, was met by a mixed response from community members; not all villagers were convinced that win-win solutions in sustainable livelihoods and conservation were possible, and the concept of reducing poverty through environmental restoration activities was still relatively new to much of the community and local authorities. Several informational meetings and consultations were held to clarify the idea and to generate ownership and buy-in from all relevant stakeholders. Gradually and incrementally, local residents and farmers committed to the shared vision. </p>

                <p>One of the most contentious obstacles to generating wholesale buyin from farmers was the property rights and land tenure issue. If the community was to create an eco-village with a collective land management ethos, individual farmers would need to surrender their alienation rights, and along with it the option of selling their land Background and Context 55 to commercial industries which often offer high premiums. The initiative worked through the elected body responsible for all administrative activities pertaining to the village, the Popular Committee, to explain to community members the rules surrounding the agreement and the new parameters for property sales. Over a period of several years, the hold-out farmers began to see the environmental and social problems caused by factories and commercial industries in neighboring villages, and, motivated to be part of a solution for community wellbeing and protecting the environment, consented to abide by the new regulations that would ultimately create Phu An Bamboo Village.</p>

                <p>The initiative has since dedicated its activities to restoring the region’s biodiversity based on the research, knowledge and active participation of the local community. The idea of not only conserving bamboo, but of protecting the genetic diversity of bamboo species, has taken the form of a Bamboo Eco-Museum and Botanical Conservancy, which currently houses more than 350 specimens of bamboo. Occupancy for the ten hectares of land on which the conservancy is located was granted by the provincial government.</p>

                <p>Phu An Bamboo Village has fifteen permanent staff members, including four researchers, five technical engineers, four farmers, and a core executive leadership drawn from the village women’s union. Student volunteers are added to the team seasonally and on an asneeded basis. The organization emphasizes participatory decisionmaking. Ideas for new activities and strategic directions for the organization are presented to and discussed with the entire community before any collective decision is taken. Community consultations and discussions usually take place in meetings with the women’s union and with village farmers.</p>
